# Archaic Cas names

Many CRISPR-associated genes have been renamed, sometimes more than once. Sequences databases often retain an archaic name, making searching for particular genes tricky. I have established this repo to keep track of the various alternatives for each Cas gene. In cases where there is no consensus in the community, this database will prefer the more consistent naming scheme.
